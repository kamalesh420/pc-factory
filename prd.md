1. App Overview & Objectives
Overview
The Customized PC Factory Platform is an end-to-end solution that allows users—starting with students and
budget-conscious buyers—to purchase fully assembled, high-quality PCs without forced or hidden
component compromises.
Unlike traditional prebuilt PC brands (Dell/HP/Lenovo), the platform emphasizes full component
transparency, budget-first decision-making, and factory-grade reliability, while keeping the experience
simple for non-technical users.
Core Objectives

3. Core Value Proposition
“Choose your budget. Get the best possible PC—no forced parts, no hidden
compromises.”
Key differentiators: - Budget-first experience - Full transparency of exact components - Guaranteed quality
standards for PSU, cooling, and motherboard - Factory-assembled and tested
4. Core Features & Functionality
4.1 Budget-First Build Selection
• 
• 
• 
Users start by selecting a budget range (e.g., Under ₹40k, ₹40k–₹60k)
Platform auto-generates the most balanced PC for that budget

4.2 Guided Customization (Safe Tweaks)
Users can optionally adjust: - RAM size - Storage size/type
System-managed (non-editable in MVP): - PSU - Cooling solution - Motherboard
This prevents bad configurations while preserving trust.
